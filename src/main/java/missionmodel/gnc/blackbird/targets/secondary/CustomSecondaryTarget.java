     *
     * The CustomSecondaryTarget takes in the Vector3D version of a custom
     * vector, observing body's name, the frame the spacecraft's orientation
     * is relative to, and the rotation axis that the secondary rotation occurs
     * about. This should be used when the primary constraint is already
     * satisfied and the desired secondary target is a vector rather than a
     * plane. The output is the unit Vector3D that defines the plane normal to
     * the rotation axis and the secondary target. The ultimate goal in
     * targeting a vector instead of a plane for secondary targeting is to
     * get the projection of the target and observer on the plane of
     * rotation. This is done in two steps the first of which is done in
     * getPointing() and the second of which is done directly after the call
     * to getPointing. This is to be used strictly as a secondary target.
     *
     * EX: Primary pointing having an antenna pointed at the Earth and
     * getting the instrument (observer) to point in another direction (or as
     * close as possible)
     *
     * @param customTarget Vector3D version of a custom target vector (assumed
     *                     to be inertial)
     *
     * @param primaryTarget The effective secondary rotation axis
     *
     * @param offset Angle in degrees that the nominal solution is rotated by about the
     *               primary rotation axis (counter-clockwise is positive when
     *               the primary rotation axis is pointed towards the viewer)
