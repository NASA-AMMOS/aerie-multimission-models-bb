     * The BodyCenterSecondaryTarget takes in the target body's name, observing
     * body's name, the frame the spacecraft's orientation is relative to,
     * and the rotation axis that the secondary rotation occurs about. This
     * should be used when the primary constraint is already satisfied and
     * the desired secondary target is a vector rather than a plane. The
     * output is the unit Vector3D that defines the plane normal to the
     * rotation axis and the secondary target. The ultimate goal in
     * targeting a vector instead of a plane for secondary targeting is to
     * get the projection of the target and observer on the plane of
     * rotation. This is done in two steps the first of which is done in
     * getPointing() and the second of which is done directly after the call
     * to getPointing. This is to be used strictly as a secondary target.
     *
     * EX: Primary pointing having an antenna pointed at the Earth and
     * getting the instrument (observer) to point at or as close as
     * possible at another body
