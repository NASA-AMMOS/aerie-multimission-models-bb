 * A Target is an object that an Observer can be oriented towards, and it provides three vectors: a pointing vector,
 * a target position vector, and a target velocity vector. Pointing and position are required separately because
 * for some target subclasses, the spacecraft is not supposed to directly point towards the position of the target.
 * Different implementations of ADCModel may require one or the other to fully resolve attitude.

     *        specified by the specific implementation getPosition, because for the primary targets this
     *        position is the vector that is intended to be aligned with the observer body-fixed vector.
     *
     *        The two different types of secondary targets are
     *        targeting a vector or targeting a plane normal to a vector. Plane targeting pointing returns the
     *        direction of the vector normal to the targeted plane and vector targeting returns the vector normal
     *        to the plane containing the primary target vector and the secondary target vector. This is because
     *        typically the cross product is immediately taken outside of the getPointing() method
     *        which is then the actual vector that is desired to be aligned with the secondary observer.
